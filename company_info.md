The GENERAL CONCEPT  
After the genocide against the Tutsi in 1994 the country has had a good governance which 
has been promoting spirit of entrepreneurship  ,  especially among the young population.  
After listening to many of the president Paul Kagame speeches encouraging out generation 
to create our own business and improving by expanding those startups , the fear that i had 
hof not being confident and of failure suddenly vanished 
Thus was the idea born of researching and products derived from stinging nettle plants 
After listening to many of the President Paul Kagame speeches encouraging our generation 
to create our own businesses and improving by expanding those start-ups; the fear that I 
always had of not being confident and of failure suddenly vanished. 
Thus was the idea born of researching and developing products derived from the stinging 
nettle plants. 
THE CONCEPT 
I was born in the Eastern Province of Nyamata in Bugesera District; and during my childhood 
one of my parents was diagnosed with liver failure and they started taking the nettle plant 
either by eating it or making the juice and drinking it and soon after they were cured. Also, I 
used to see our neighbors use it to cook it and to make different drinks derived from the 
plant. 
In the end of year 2017, because of the many campaigns encouraging us to create our own 
jobs through start-ups, I decided to plant the stinging nettle plants in the small farm. My 
neighbors brought those plants for 80,000 RWF and it motivated me 
to continue the project development. 
This small experiment game self-confidence and motivated me to take it to the next level,, 
and in t he next three months i  exposed my project in my village explaining what i do and 
how i can contribute to society and i won the cance to expose it to teh district level  in the 
women category. After teh exposition i registered my company in RDB  and i sought a 
certificate from  the Rwanda Standard Board soi can continue to improve the quality of my 
prorducts
